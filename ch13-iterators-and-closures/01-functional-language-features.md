## Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures ##

Rust follows the pattern of *functional programming*.

In functional programming languages, it is possible to implement functions 
that can be stored as variables or passed to other functions as parameters.

> Note: In other languages, like C#, you may talk about delegates (of which
> closures are an example).

Rust includes (among other functional concepts):

* Closures:
    * Function-like constructs that can be stored as variables
* Iterators:
    * Mechanisms to process collections and series
