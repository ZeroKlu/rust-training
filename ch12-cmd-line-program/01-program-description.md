## Description ##

This chapter is a hands-on practical where we will develop a simple
implementation of the ```grep``` (**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint) command.

This will reinforce the following concepts:

* [Organizing Code](../ch07-packages/)
* [Vectors and Strings](../ch08-collections/)
* [Error Handling](../ch09-error-handling/)
* [Traits and Lifetimes](../ch10-generics-traits-lifetimes/)
* [Testing](../ch11-automated-tests/)

To create the project, run the following commands:

```
cargo new minigrep --vcs none

cd minigrep

code .\src\main.rs
