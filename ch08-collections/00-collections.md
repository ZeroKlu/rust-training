## Common Collections ##

Collections are supplied in the standard library and can
contain multiple values.

The collection types are stored on the heap, unlike arrays
and tuples, which are stored on the stack.

Three common collection types are:

* **Vector**: Stores a variable number of values next to 
  each other.
* **String**: Collection of characters
* **Hash Map**: Allows the association of *keys* to the
  values. (Implementation of general type ```map```)
