## Numerical Operations ##

Standard numerical operations are supported for all integer and floating-point types and include:

* Addition
  ```rust
  let sum = 1 + 2; // 3
  ```
* Subtraction
  ```rust
  let difference = 2 - 1; // 1
  ```
* Multiplication
  ```rust
  let product = 2 * 3; // 6
  ```
* Division
  ```rust
  let quotient = 6.0 / 2.4; // 2.5
  ```
* Integer Division
  ```rust
  let truncated = 5 / 2; // 2 (truncates decimal when dividing integers)
  ```
* Modulus (Remainder)
  ```rust
  let remainder = 5 % 2; // 1
  ```
